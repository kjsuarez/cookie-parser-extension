### A browser extension for sharing login credentials without sharing passwords 

#### Available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-serial/obnbhdhfpnefodcnkldleddlobalfaob/)


Have you ever wanted to share your login information with a friend, but didn't want to reveal your password? Have you ever started a watch party only to discover too late that somebody in your party doesn't have the subscription service you're using? Cookie Serial exists to solve these kinds of problems.

Websites store login information on your browser in the form of session cookies. Whenever your browser communicates with a website it includes these session cookies within the request. In effect, if you posses a user's session cookies for a given domain, you are effectively indistinguishable from that user from the server's perspective (excluding fingerprinting).

  

Cookie Serial makes it easy to see what cookies a website has stored on your browser and (at your discretion) share them with your peers in the form of a JSON string.

> Sharing session cookies can pose a serious security threat, so Cookie Serial offers the ability to secure your serialized cookies with AES-256 encryption. Never share your session information publicly.

  

We must always remember that the information websites store on our browsers **belongs to us** and we have the right to use that data how we like. Share your logins.

  

**Cookie Serial will never collect or sell your data.**
